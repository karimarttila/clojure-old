# Webstore Demonstration

The original Webstore demonstration is under [clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo](../clj-ring-cljs-reagent-demo) directory for historical reasons (there are Blog links to that directory etc.).

I started a [re-implementation of the Simple Server](simple-server) - the idea was to learn deps.edn and new more effective ways to use repl. The API should be exactly same as in the old Simple Server (and actually with all Simple Servers implemented in Clojure, Javascript/Node, Java, Python and Go).

Later I also did a third version of this exercise using Integrant, see: [integrant-simple-server](integrant-simple-server). The idea of this third exercise was to learn and explore the [Integrant library](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant) and also the [Integrant-REPL workflow](https://github.com/weavejester/integrant-repl) which is popular in Metosin (and to see why it is so popular in Metosin).
